			<h1>Hello to all people visiting my very first page done in HTML5!</h1>

			<h3>My name is Grzegorz (you can say to me just Greg :) ), I'm 32 years old and I'm from<br> Poland, but from 10 years living in Spain.

			<p>Finaly I started the course, because one of my best friend recomend that to me and trust<br> 
				me for beggining everything here was looking hard. But don't be worried with good way<br> 
				of explaining everything become easier :D<br>
				I'm making course named "The complete Web Developer in 2022: Zero to Mastery".<br>
				I would like recommend to everybody this course with teacher Andrei, he have ways to explain<br> 
				good the thigs!<hr>
			</p>
			<p>I just started my course in 02.07.2022, and in next day I was able to create this very small<br> and very simple page, but in true I feel go even with that.<br>
				First exercise was to make our own page wit knowledge what we leraned till now.<br>
				And how you can see even in so short time I was able to create something :)<br>
				If you are thinking about make that course, or any course of programming, <br> 
				don't think anymore! Just do it!
